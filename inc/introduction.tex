Bitcoin is a electronic payment system relying on cryptography and a distributed ledger called the blockchain \cite{nakamoto2008}.
Computational power spent to add transactions to the blockchain maintained on every node; making the transactions irreversible as the blockchain grows and more computational power is used, and thus removes the need for trusted third parties to verify transactions.
