\chapter*{Preface}
This paper is a Master's thesis which was carried out in the autumn semester of 2018 in AIMT at NTNU. The main topics of the thesis is Bitcoin and the Lightning Network, which both are two large systems under active development. Both require a background in computer science for getting a detailed understanding of their operation, but the required background information on both will be provided. This project started as a exploration in the interaction between these systems, which resulted in a approach where the Lightning Network is explored trough the Bitcoin blockchian. While this provided a good scope for the project, the project still had exploratory nature until the first results was produced. 
Even with the bitcoin blockchain as a main approach, implementations for both systems had to be used, and software developed for data collection and processing in relation to both.
